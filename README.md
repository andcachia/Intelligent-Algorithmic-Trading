# Intelligent Algorithmic Trading Using Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms

The aim of this project was to create an autonomous system for automatic stock trading. The first approach was that of  using  traditional  time  series  analysis  techniques,  in  the  form of technical indicators, to monitor the market index. The second approach  used  machine  learning  in  the  form  of  an  Artificial Neural Network. The two approaches were then combined into a hybrid trading system, and the results compared to other systems that attempt to predict stock market price fluctuations or systems that  attempt  to  use  algorithmic  trading  techniques.  Finally,  the hybrid  system  was  optimized  using  Genetic  Algorithms.
